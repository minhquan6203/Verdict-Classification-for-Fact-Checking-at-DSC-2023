# UIT Data Science Challenge 2023

Recent developments of modern chatbot systems such as ChatGPT of OpenAI or BARD of Google have raised concerns about the information validity they provide. Information checking has therefore become a crucial part and must be integrated into any modern chatbot system in order to provide reliable information for users. In this [Challenge](https://dsc.uit.edu.vn/) within [Group B](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/15497), participants will take part in an information-checking task. In particular, we provide ISE-DSC01, a dataset containing various claims and appropriate texts. Participants have to develop methods to verify claims given their texts.
